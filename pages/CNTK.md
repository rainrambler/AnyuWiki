- The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit ([https://cntk.ai](https://cntk.ai)) is a unified deep learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph.
- CNTK allows users to easily realize and combine popular model types such
   as feed-forward [[DNN]]s, convolutional nets ([[CNN]]s), and recurrent networks
   ([[RNN]]s/[[LSTM]]s). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error 
  backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and 
  parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers.

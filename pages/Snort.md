- Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System ([[IPS]]) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generates alerts for users.
- Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses: As a packet sniffer like [[tcpdump]], as a packet logger — which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal and business use alike.

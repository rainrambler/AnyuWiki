- In 2012, Alessandro Chiesa et al developed the zk-SNARK protocol, an acronym for *[zero-knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) succinct non-interactive [argument of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_knowledge)*. [7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof#cite_note-bitansky2012-7) The first widespread application of zk-SNARKs was in the [Zerocash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zcash) [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) protocol, where zero-knowledge cryptography provides the computational backbone, by facilitating mathematical proofs that one party has possession of certain information without revealing what that information is.[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof#cite_note-sasson2016-8) Zcash utilized zk-SNARKs to facilitate four distinct transaction types: private, shielding, deshielding, and public. This protocol allowed users to determine how much data was shared with the public ledger for each transaction.[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof#cite_note-9) [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) zk-Rollups also utilize zk-SNARKs to increase scalability.[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof#cite_note-10)

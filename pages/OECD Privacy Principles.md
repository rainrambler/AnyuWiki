- Generally Accepted Privacy Principles ([[GAPP]])
  The Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) were developed by the American Institute of CPAs ([[AICPA]]) and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ([[CICA]]). Introduced in 2003 and updated in 2006 and 2009, they are similar to the [[OECD]] Privacy Principles, with a focus toward implementation.
- According to the AICPA, "they are based on internationally known fair information practices included in many privacy laws and regulations of various jurisdictions around the world and recognized good privacy practices."
- The GAPP are popular among Canadian privacy practitioners.

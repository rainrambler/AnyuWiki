- Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)
- The Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) is a tool for evaluating and improving cybersecurity. It was developed in 2012 by the U.S. energy sector and the Department of Energy (DOE). The C2M2 is managed by the DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) division. CESER’s CEDS division advances research, development, and deployment of innovative technologies, tools, and techniques to reduce risk to the Nation’s energy infrastructure.

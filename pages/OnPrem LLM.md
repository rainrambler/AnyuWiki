- OnPrem.LLM is a simple #Python package that makes it easier to run large language models ([[LLM]]s) on your own machines using non-public data (possibly behind corporate firewalls).
- Inspired largely by the [[privateGPT]] GitHub repo, OnPrem.LLM is intended to help integrate local LLMs into practical applications.

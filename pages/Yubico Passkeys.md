- [[Passkey]] is a term that the industry is rallying around for [[FIDO]] credentials that can fully replace, rather than only augment, passwords. These are called resident or discoverable credentials in the specs. We think “passkey” is a better term than “discoverable [[webauthn]]/fido credential,” because it evokes its ability to replace passwords in an accessible way.
- They’re the same because YubiKeys have had the ability to create these [[Passwordless]] enabled FIDO2 credentials (passkeys) since the [[YubiKey]] 5 Series became available in mid-2018. Currently, YubiKeys can store a maximum of 25 passkeys.

- As I mentioned towards the end of my previous blog post, where I detailed running my blog on the [[PinePhone]]'s GSM/[[WWAN]]/GPS modem, I suspected that the daemon responsible for parsing AT commands on the modem's side is susceptible to OS command injection, as it uses a lot of system() calls. My hunch turned out to be true.

- apkutil is a useful utility for mobile security testing. This tool makes it easy to resign the APK, check for potentially sensitive files and AndroidManifest.xml in the APK.
- It is a wrapper for [[apktool]] and [[apksigner]], aapt commands. I've only checked it works on macOS. iOS version is here.

- RWKV is a novel large language model architecture
- RWKV is a RNN with transformer-level LLM performance. It can be directly
   trained like a [[GPT]] (parallelizable). So it's combining the best of [[RNN]] 
  and transformer - great performance, fast inference, saves VRAM, fast 
  training, "infinite" ctx_len, and free sentence embedding.

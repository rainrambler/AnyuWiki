- Cryptographic Hash Properties
- § Preimage resistance
	- § Given a hash h it should be difficult to find any message m such that `h = hash(m)`
- § Second preimage resistance
	- § Given an input m1 it should be difficult to find another input m2 - where `m1 != m2` - such that `hash(m1) = hash(m2)`
- § Collision resistance
	- § It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that `hash(m1) = hash(m2)`

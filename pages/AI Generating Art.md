- A good place to start: [NightCafe](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/) lets you generate art using either VQGAN+CLIP (”Artistic”) or CLIP-Guided Diffusion (”Coherent”). You can do this without writing any code. Then it allows me to order a print online. (I didn’t, though, since I didn’t succeed in making anything good.)
- If you want to get your hands dirty, the **pixray** library is based on the artist-critic model and looks like a great place to start with creating AI art.

- You can also try **StyleCLIP** online: [https://replicate.com/orpatashnik/styleclip](https://replicate.com/orpatashnik/styleclip). replicate.com has lots of ML models, and many of them are useful for art!

- Pixray is an image generation system. It combines previous ideas including:
	- Perception Engines which uses image augmentation and iteratively optimises images against an ensemble of classifiers
	- CLIP guided GAN imagery from Ryan Murdoch and Katherine Crowson as well as modifictions such as CLIPDraw from Kevin Frans
	- Useful ways of navigating latent space from Sampling Generative Networks

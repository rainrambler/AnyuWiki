- Free and open source, powerful network-wide ads & trackers blocking [[DNS]] server.
- AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.
- It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.  It's based on software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/) servers, and both share a lot of code.

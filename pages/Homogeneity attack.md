- A homogoneity attack is a [[privacy attack]] that can be applied to data that is anonymized using a simple [[generalization technique]] if the data share the same values of their [[quasi-identifier]]s and have the same values for their sensitive attributes. If the groups do not contain different values, an attacker can reveal sensitive information simply by finding out which group an individual belongs to (if every individual in the group is diagnosed with a heart attack, it is easy for an attacker to find out the diagnosis of the individual who belongs to that group). In such cases, the data becomes vulnerable to a homogeneity attack. [[k-anonymity]] is not a sufficient prevention against this attack, the [[l-diversity]] method is intended to protect data from these types of attacks.
- **同源性攻击**是一种隐私攻击，如果数据共享其准标识符的相同值，并且其敏感属性具有相同的值，则可以将其应用于使用简单泛化技术匿名化的数据。如果组不包含不同的值，则攻击者只需找出个人所属的组即可泄露敏感信息（如果组中的每个人都被诊断出患有心脏病发作，则攻击者很容易找出属于该组的个人的诊断）。在这种情况下，数据容易受到同质性攻击。K-匿名性不足以防止这种攻击，L-Diversity方法旨在保护数据免受这些类型的攻击。

- A modern practical book about cryptography for developers with code examples, covering core concepts like: hashes (like [[SHA-3]] and [[BLAKE2]]), [[MAC]] codes (like [[HMAC]] and [[GMAC]]), key derivation functions (like [[scrypt]], [[Argon2]]), key agreement protocols (like [[DHKE]], [[ECDH]]), symmetric ciphers (like [[AES]] and [[ChaCha20]], cipher block modes, authenticated encryption, [[AEAD]], AES-[[GCM]], ChaCha20-[[Poly1305]]), asymmetric ciphers and public-key cryptosystems ([[RSA]], [[ECC]], [[ECIES]]), elliptic curve cryptography ([[ECC]], [[secp256k1]], [[curve25519]]), digital signatures ([[ECDSA]] and [[EdDSA]]), secure random numbers ([[PRNG]], [[CSRNG]]) and quantum-safe cryptography, along with crypto libraries and developer tools, with a lots of code examples in Python and other languages.
